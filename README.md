# Smart Medical Inventory Management System

## Project Overview

The **Smart Medical Inventory Management System** is a web-based application designed to simplify and improve medical inventory management. It helps manage medicine records, stock quantities, suppliers, expiry dates, and customer orders through a centralized platform.

The system uses a combination of relational and NoSQL databases to manage structured inventory information and medicine images efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface with role-based access and database-driven operations.

## Objectives

- Maintain centralized records of medicines and inventory.
- Monitor medicine quantities and identify low-stock items.
- Track medicine expiry dates to support timely stock management.
- Manage medicine companies and related information.
- Support customer access and order management.
- Store and retrieve medicine images efficiently.
- Maintain data consistency through database constraints and transactions.
- Provide secure access through authentication and role-based authorization.

## Key Features

### Inventory Management
- Add, update, view, and manage medicine records.
- Maintain medicine stock quantities.
- Monitor low-stock medicines.
- Track expiry dates.
- Manage medicine companies.

### Customer Management
- Customer registration and authentication.
- Customer access to available medicine information.
- Customer order management.
- Password management.

### Database Management
- MySQL for structured and relational data.
- MongoDB for medicine image metadata.
- MongoDB GridFS for storing and retrieving image files.
- Database indexing for efficient data retrieval.
- Transaction management to maintain data consistency.

### Security
- Role-based authentication and authorization.
- Protected application routes and API endpoints.
- Environment variables for sensitive database configuration.
- Input validation and database integrity constraints.

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js, React, TypeScript |
| Backend | Next.js API Routes / Route Handlers |
| Relational Database | MySQL |
| NoSQL Database | MongoDB |
| File Storage | MongoDB GridFS |
| Styling | CSS |
| Version Control | Git and GitHub |

## Database Architecture

The project uses two database technologies:

### 1. MySQL

MySQL is used to store structured and relational information, including:

- User details and account information.
- Medicine and inventory records.
- Company information.
- Stock-related information.
- Customer orders.
- Inventory adjustment records.

Relational database concepts such as primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, joins, and transactions are used to maintain data integrity.

### 2. MongoDB

MongoDB is used to manage medicine image metadata and related document-based information.

### 3. MongoDB GridFS

GridFS is used to store and retrieve medicine image files. Image metadata is maintained in MongoDB, while the actual file data is stored through the GridFS bucket.

## User Roles

The application supports role-based access control with the following roles:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Admin | Manage inventory, medicines, companies, users, stock adjustments, and overall system operations. |
| Customer | Access available medicine information, manage account details, and place and manage orders. |

## Team Members and Responsibilities

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- Node.js and npm
- MySQL Server
- MongoDB Community Server
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chandrakanth2704/Smart-Medical-Inventory-Management-System.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Smart-Medical-Inventory-Management-System
```

### 2. Navigate to the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file inside the `frontend` directory.

Add the required MySQL and MongoDB connection configuration using the environment variable names expected by the project's database configuration files.

**Important:** Do not commit `.env.local` or expose database credentials in the GitHub repository.

### 5. Configure the Databases

- Start the MySQL server.
- Create and configure the project database.
- Execute the required SQL schema and initialization scripts.
- Start the MongoDB server.
- Configure the MongoDB database and GridFS storage as required by the application.

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the application in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### 7. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Testing

The application should be tested for:

- User authentication and role-based authorization.
